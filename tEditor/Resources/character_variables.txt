Declaration:

char [variable name];

A 'char' variable holds a character value.
It allocates the necessary memory upon declaration.
At the end of the program, the memory is freed automatically.
The variable name can be used to represent the value stored in it.
For example, take

char c = 'a';

The value of 'c' is now the letter "a".
The value can be changed via the following syntax:

[variable name] = [character value];

All value assignments should be contained in single quotes (' ').
