When you declare a variable, it automatically reserves memory for the given type.
Using pointers, we can dynamically allocate memory.
This means memory can be reserved dependent on various factors.
Using dynamic memory allocation, memory can be managed more efficiently.

Let's take a step back to pointers first:

int * pointer;
pointer = new int;

This allocates the space for a new integer element and assigns the pointer to it.
It can also be done as an array:

pointer = new int[5];

This allocates memory for five integer elements.
The pointer is returned to the first element of the sequence.
