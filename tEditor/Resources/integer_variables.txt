Declaration:

int [variable name];

An 'int' variable holds an integer value.
It allocates the necessary memory upon declaration.
At the end of the program, the memory is freed automatically.
The variable name can be used to represent the value stored in it.
For example, take

int x = 5;

int y = 4 + x;

The variable 'y' would be set equal to 9 on declaration.
The value can be changed via the following syntax:

[variable name] = [integer value];

If a decimal value is assigned to an integer, it will be
rounded down to the nearest integer.
