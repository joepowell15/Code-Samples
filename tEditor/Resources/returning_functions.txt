Declaration:

[type] [function name]([parameters]){
	[operations]
}

Example:

int function(int a, int b){
	int c = b + a;
	return c;
}

Returning functions return a value of the same type.
For example, int functions return int values.
When calling the function, values are passed in as parameters.
These parameters are treated like variables only within that specific execution of the function.
Any variables declared inside the function only exist within that certain instance.

Calling (example function above):

d = function(5, 4);

The variable 'd' now has a value of 9.

Other types such as char and float can also be used.
