Declaration:

bool [variable name];

A 'bool' variable holds a true/false value.
It allocates the necessary memory upon declaration.
At the end of the program, the memory is freed automatically.
The variable name can be used to represent the value stored in it.
For example, take

bool b = true;

The name 'b' can now be used in place of true.
The value can be changed via the following syntax:

[variable name] = [true/false];
