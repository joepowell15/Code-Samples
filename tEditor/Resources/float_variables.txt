Declaration:

float [variable name];

A 'float' variable holds a decimal value.
It allocates the necessary memory upon declaration.
At the end of the program, the memory is freed automatically.
The variable name can be used to represent the value stored in it.
For example, take

float f = 3.14;

The value of 'f' is now 3.14.
The value can be changed via the following syntax:

[variable name] = [decimal value];
