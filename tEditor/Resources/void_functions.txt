Declaration:

void [function name]([parameters]){
	[operations]
}

Example:

void function(int a, float b, char c){
	b = b + a;
	printf("%f\n", b);
	printf("%c\n", c);
	return;
}

Void functions perform actions that don't require any return value.
They're used often for displaying information that doesn't need to be stored.
When calling the function, values are passed in as parameters.
These parameters are treated like variables only within that specific execution of the function.
Any variables declared inside the function are only active for that instance of the function.

Calling (example function above):

function(5, 3.14, 'a');

Output:

8.14
a
