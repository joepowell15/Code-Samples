Recursive functions call themselves.

For example:

void annoying_song(){
	printf("I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:\n");
	annoying_song();
	return;
}

Output:

I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
I know a song that you don't know and it goes like this:
...

It repeats indefinitely.
Remember to add something to stop a recursive function in order to not loop forever.
An if statement to make the function return before it repeats would suffice.
